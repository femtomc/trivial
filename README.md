# idle

Quality gate plugin for Claude Code. Blocks Claude from stopping (via Claude Code's Stop hook) until work passes review by an independent agent. 

Be aware: can accidentally (or intentionally) be used to run Claude Code for many hours without intervention.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/evil-mind-evil-sword/idle/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

This installs:
- `jwz` - Agent messaging
- `tissue` - Issue tracking
- `jq` - JSON parsing (if needed)
- The idle plugin (registered with Claude Code)

Those other two binaries (`jwz` and `tissue`) are small Zig programs which allow Claude Code to store issues, messages, retain state (all in JSONL + SQLite, like `beads`) -- and are used by `idle` to track the state required to enforce the reviewer pattern (as well as giving Claude Code a place to store issues, research notes, etc). The plugin assumes these binaries are available and contains explicit instructions for how the agent should use them. The goal here is to make it easy to install these and get started (meaning: the goal is you shouldn't have to think about them!)

## Motivation

LLMs struggle to reliably evaluate their own outputs ([Huang et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01798)). A model asked to verify its work tends to confirm rather than critique. This creates a gap in agentic coding workflows—agents can exit believing they've completed a task when issues remain.

Research on multi-agent debate suggests a path forward: models produce more accurate outputs when they critique each other ([Du et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14325); [Liang et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19118)).

idle applies this idea: rather than prompting agents to review themselves, it blocks exit until an independent reviewer (alice, a subagent) explicitly approves.

## Usage

```
#idle <your prompt>
```

Review is opt-in per-prompt. After alice approves, the gate resets automatically.

## How It Works

```
Agent works → tries to exit → Stop hook → alice reviewed? → block/allow
```

1. **Stop hook** intercepts every agent exit attempt
2. `#idle` at start of prompt enables review via [jwz](https://github.com/evil-mind-evil-sword/zawinski)
3. If review enabled but no approval: blocks exit, agent must spawn alice
4. **alice** (adversarial reviewer) examines the work
5. Creates [tissue](https://github.com/evil-mind-evil-sword/tissue) issues for problems found
6. Posts decision: `COMPLETE` allows exit, `ISSUES` keeps agent working

## Design Philosophy

Three principles guide idle's architecture:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Pull over push** | Agents retrieve context on demand, not via large upfront injections |
| **Safety over policy** | Critical guardrails enforced mechanically (hooks), not via prompts |
| **Pointer over payload** | Messages contain references (issue IDs, session IDs), not inline content |

## Skills

idle extends Claude Code with domain-specific capabilities:

| Skill | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **reviewing** | Query other LLMs for a second opinion | When you want another model to check the work |
| **researching** | Cited research with source verification | Complex topics requiring evidence |
| **issue-tracking** | Git-native work tracking via tissue | Managing tasks, dependencies, priorities |
| **technical-writing** | Multi-layer document review (structure/clarity/evidence) | Documentation, design docs, papers |
| **bib-managing** | Bibliography curation with bibval | Academic citations, reference validation |

### Reviewing Skill

The reviewing skill queries external models for independent perspectives:

```
Priority: codex CLI → gemini CLI → claude -p fallback
```

This provides a second opinion from a different model. Configure the specific models via each CLI's settings.

## Alice

alice is the reviewer agent. It critiques the main agent's work rather than accepting it uncritically. Key properties:

- **Model**: Claude Opus
- **Access**: Read-only (cannot modify files)
- **Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash (restricted to `tissue` and `jwz` commands)

alice reviews proportionally to scope:
- Simple Q&A → instant `COMPLETE`
- Bug fix → verify the fix is correct
- New feature → check implementation completeness
- Refactor → ensure behavior is preserved

When issues are found, alice creates tissue issues tagged `alice-review` and blocks exit until they're resolved.

## Session Traces

idle captures session events for post-hoc analysis via the `idle` CLI:

```bash
# Show trace for a session
idle trace <session_id>

# Verbose mode - see tool inputs and outputs
idle trace <session_id> -v

# Export as GraphViz DOT
idle trace <session_id> --format dot > trace.dot
```

**Example output:**

```
=== Session abc123 ===

[1] prompt_received: "Fix the auth bug" (01KE5DEF)
[2] tool_completed: Read (01KE5GHI)
[3] tool_completed: Edit (01KE5JKL)
[4] tool_completed: Bash [FAILED] (01KE5MNO)

4 events total
=== End Session ===
```

Traces help debug tool failures and understand agent behavior.
