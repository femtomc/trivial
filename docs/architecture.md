# Architecture

idle is a Claude Code plugin that provides multi-model development agents. This document explains how it works for contributors and advanced users.

## Overview

idle delegates specialized tasks to different AI models:

```
User → Claude Code → idle agents/commands
                         ↓
         ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
         ↓               ↓               ↓

                                       ↓
                              ┌────────┴────────┐
                              ↓                 ↓
                           Codex            Gemini
                          (OpenAI)          (Google)
```

- **Haiku agents** (`explorer`, `librarian`): Fast, cheap operations
- **Opus agents** (`oracle`, `reviewer`, `documenter`): Complex reasoning tasks
- **External model integration**: Codex for diverse perspectives, Gemini for writing

```

The idle architecture is moving towards a hybrid model:

- **Plugin**: Embedded in Claude Code. Provides slash commands (/loop, /cancel), hooks (Stop hook for loop continuation), and agent dispatch.
- **Controller** (future): Separate binary. Provides `idle status` for observability, `idle tui` for interactive control. Reads state from jwz.
- **jwz**: The shared state layer. Both plugin and controller read/write to jwz topics (loop:current, loop:anchor, etc.).
- This separation allows external tools to observe and control loops without being inside Claude Code.

## idle status Command

The `idle status` command (implemented by the future controller) queries jwz for current loop state:

```bash
idle status
# Output:
# Loop: issue
# Iteration: 3/10
# Issue: auth-123
# Worktree: .worktrees/idle/auth-123
# Updated: 2 minutes ago

idle status --json
# Output:
# {"mode":"issue","iteration":3,"max":10,"issue_id":"auth-123",...}
```

Implementation:
```bash
# Query loop:current topic
STATE=$(jwz read "loop:current" | tail -1)
echo "$STATE" | jq -r '.stack[-1]'
```

Use cases:
- Check if a loop is stuck
- Monitor progress from outside Claude
- Script automation around loop state

### plugin.json

Minimal metadata for the plugin:

```json
{
  "name": "idle",
  "version": "0.4.0",
  "description": "Multi-model development agents...",
  "author": { "name": "femtomc" }
}
```

## Agent Structure

Agents are markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: When to use this agent
model: haiku | opus
tools: Comma-separated list of allowed tools
---

# Agent persona and instructions

## Constraints
What the agent MUST NOT do

## Workflow
How the agent operates

## Output Format
Expected response structure
```

### Key Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Agent identifier |
| `description` | Shown in Claude Code's agent picker |
| `model` | `haiku` for fast/cheap, `opus` for complex |
| `tools` | Allowed tools (e.g., `Read, Grep, Glob, Bash`) |

### Agent Patterns

**Read-only agents** (oracle, explorer):
- Cannot write/edit files
- Bash restricted to specific commands only

**Artifact writers** (librarian, documenter):
- Can create/edit files in `.claude/plugins/idle/` (librarian) or docs (documenter)
- Cannot modify source code

**Reviewer** (reviewer):
- Writes review artifacts to `.claude/plugins/idle/reviewer/`
- Read-only access to source code


## Command Structure

Commands are markdown files that define slash commands:

```markdown
---
description: What the command does
---

# Command Name

## Usage
How to invoke the command

## Workflow
Step-by-step execution

## Output
Expected completion signals
```

Commands are user-invocable via `/idle:dev:command` or `/idle:loop:command`.

## Loop State Management

The `/loop` command uses a **Stop hook** to intercept Claude's exit and force re-entry until the task is complete. It operates in two modes: task mode (with args) and issue mode (without args, works through issue tracker with auto-land).

### How It Works

```
User runs /loop "fix tests"
         ↓
Command posts state to jwz topic "loop:current"
         ↓
Claude works on task, tries to exit
         ↓
Stop hook intercepts exit
         ↓
Hook reads state from jwz, checks for completion signals
         ↓
If <loop-done> found → allow exit
If not found → block exit, re-inject prompt, increment iteration
```

### State Storage via jwz

Loop state is stored as JSON messages in the `loop:current` topic:

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "event": "STATE",
  "run_id": "loop-1703123456-12345",
  "updated_at": "2024-12-21T10:30:00Z",
  "stack": [
    {
      "id": "grind-1703123456-12345",
      "mode": "grind",
      "iter": 3,
      "max": 100,
      "prompt_file": "/tmp/idle-grind-xxx/prompt.txt"
    },
    {
      "id": "issue-auth-123-1703123456",
      "mode": "issue",
      "iter": 2,
      "max": 10,
      "prompt_file": "/tmp/idle-issue-xxx/prompt.txt",
      "issue_id": "auth-123"
    }
  ]
}
```

Key design choices:
- **Stack model**: Supports nested loops (grind → issue). Top of stack is current loop.
- **`prompt_file`**: Prompts stored in temp files to avoid JSON escaping issues.
- **TTL**: States older than 2 hours are considered stale (prevents zombie loops).
- **Fallback**: If jwz unavailable, falls back to `.claude/idle-loop.local.md` state file.

### Completion Signals

Commands emit structured signals that the stop hook detects:

- `<loop-done>COMPLETE</loop-done>` - Task finished successfully (auto-lands in issue mode)
- `<loop-done>MAX_ITERATIONS</loop-done>` - Hit iteration limit
- `<loop-done>STUCK</loop-done>` - No progress, needs user input

### Escape Hatches

If you get stuck in an infinite loop:

1. `/cancel` - Graceful cancellation via command
2. `IDLE_LOOP_DISABLE=1 claude` - Environment variable bypass
3. `rm -rf .jwz/` - Manual reset of all messaging state

## Git Worktrees

In issue mode, `/loop` creates a Git worktree for each issue to enable clean isolation.

### Structure

```
main repo/                          .worktrees/idle/
├── src/                            ├── auth-123/     ← issue worktree
├── .tissue/                        │   └── (branch: idle/issue/auth-123)
├── .worktrees/ (gitignored)        └── perf-456/     ← another issue
└── ...                                 └── (branch: idle/issue/perf-456)
```

### Lifecycle

1. **Create** (`/loop` without args):
   - Picks first ready issue from `tissue ready`
   - Creates worktree at `.worktrees/idle/<id>/`
   - Creates branch `idle/issue/<id>` from base ref
   - Stores worktree path in jwz loop state
   - Ensures `.worktrees/` is gitignored

2. **Work**:
   - Stop hook injects worktree context on each iteration
   - All file operations use absolute paths under worktree
   - tissue commands run from main repo (not worktree)

3. **Complete & Auto-Land**:
   - Agent emits `<loop-done>COMPLETE</loop-done>`
   - Stop hook verifies review requirements (reads from jwz)
   - Auto-lands: fast-forward merge to main, push, cleanup worktree
   - Updates tissue status to closed
   - Picks next issue automatically

4. **Cleanup** (manual, if needed):
   ```bash
   git worktree prune      # Clean up orphaned worktrees
   git worktree list       # Check current worktrees
   ```

### Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/loop` | Pick issue, create worktree, work, auto-land, repeat |
| `/loop <task>` | Task mode (no worktree, simple iteration) |
| `/cancel` | Cancel active loop |

### Stop Hook Integration

The stop hook injects worktree context on each iteration:
```
WORKTREE CONTEXT:
- Working directory: /path/to/.worktrees/idle/auth-123
- Branch: idle/issue/auth-123
- Issue: auth-123

IMPORTANT: All file operations must use absolute paths under /path/to/.worktrees/idle/auth-123
```

## Hooks Philosophy

idle uses a **minimal hooks strategy** to avoid context bloat:

- **Pull over push** - Let Claude fetch state on-demand via jwz/tissue/git
- **Safety over policy** - Hooks prevent damage; commands enforce workflows
- **Pointer over payload** - Emit locations, not full content

### Active Hooks

| Hook | Purpose | Output |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Stop** | Loop continuation | Block + re-inject prompt |
| **PreToolUse** | Safety guardrails | Block only on dangerous ops |
| **PreCompact** | Recovery anchor | Single-line pointer to jwz |

### PreToolUse (Safety)

Blocks destructive Bash commands before execution:

- `git push --force` to main/master
- `git reset --hard`
- `rm -rf /` or home directory
- `drop database` commands

Silent when allowing - no context consumed for safe operations.

### PreCompact (Recovery)

Before context compaction, persists current task state to `loop:anchor` topic:

```json
{
  "goal": "Working on issue: auth-123",
  "mode": "issue",
  "iteration": "3/10",
  "progress": "Recent commits: abc123; def456",
  "next_step": "Continue working on the task"
}
```

Emits single line: `"IDLE: Recovery anchor saved. After compaction: jwz read loop:anchor"`

### SubagentStop (Second Opinion Enforcement)

Ensures reviewer agent obtains second opinion before completing:

**Detection**: Identifies reviewer by output patterns (`**Status**: LGTM | CHANGES_REQUESTED`)

**Enforcement** (exit code 2 = block):
- Must invoke `codex exec` or `claude -p` for second opinion
- Must include `## Second Opinion` section with actual findings
- Must not have placeholder content

**Rationale**: Single-model reviews exhibit self-bias. The hook enforces the multi-model consensus requirement documented in `agents/reviewer.md`.

### Hooks We Don't Use

| Hook | Why Silent |
|------|-----------|
| SessionStart | Claude pulls state on-demand |
| UserPromptSubmit | Belongs in commands, not hooks |
| PostToolUse | Updates go to jwz quietly |

## External Model Integration

### Codex (OpenAI)

Used by: `oracle`, `reviewer`

Pattern: Dialogue-based consultation

```bash
codex exec "You are helping with [TASK].

Context: [RELEVANT CODE/PROBLEM]

Question: [SPECIFIC ASK]"
```

Agents iterate with Codex until reaching consensus or identifying clear disagreement.

### Gemini (Google)

Used by: `documenter`

Pattern: Director-writer relationship

```bash
gemini "You are writing documentation.

TASK: [WHAT TO WRITE]

CONTEXT: [CODE SNIPPETS, ARCHITECTURE]

STRUCTURE: [EXPECTED SECTIONS]"
```

The documenter reviews Gemini's output, sends corrections, and iterates until satisfied.

## Agent Messaging

Agents communicate asynchronously via [zawinski](https://github.com/femtomc/zawinski) (`jwz` CLI), a topic-based messaging CLI.

### Topic Naming Convention

| Pattern | Example | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `project:<name>` | `project:idle` | Project-wide announcements |
| `issue:<id>` | `issue:auth-123` | Per-issue discussion |
| `agent:<name>` | `agent:oracle` | Direct agent communication |

### Commands

```bash
# Initialize (once per project)
jwz init

# Create topic and post
jwz topic new "issue:auth-123"
jwz post "issue:auth-123" -m "[oracle] STARTED: Analyzing auth feature"

# Read and reply
jwz read "issue:auth-123"
jwz reply <msg-id> -m "[oracle] FINDING: Race condition in handler.go:45"

# Search across all messages
jwz search "security"
```

### Message Format

```
[AGENT] ACTION: description

Examples:
[oracle] STARTED: Analyzing auth feature
[oracle] FINDING: Race condition in handler.go:45
[reviewer] BLOCKING: Security issue in token validation
[librarian] RESEARCH: API deprecated in v3
```

### Messaging vs Artifacts

| Use Case | Mechanism | Location |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Status updates | jwz only | `.jwz/` |
| Quick findings | jwz only | `.jwz/` |
| Research reports | Artifact + jwz notification | `.claude/plugins/idle/{agent}/` |
| Code reviews | Artifact + jwz notification | `.claude/plugins/idle/{agent}/` |
| Design discussions | jwz thread | `.jwz/` |
| Design decisions | Artifact + jwz notification | `.claude/plugins/idle/{agent}/` |

**Boundary test:** "Would someone need this without the conversation context?" If yes, it's an artifact.

Messages provide the conversation graph (threading, discovery). Artifacts provide durable content.

### Artifact Notification Protocol

When an agent creates an artifact (markdown file), it MUST post a notification to jwz for discoverability:

```bash
jwz post "issue:<issue-id>" --role <agent-name> \
  -m "[<agent>] <TYPE>: <topic>
Path: .claude/plugins/idle/<agent>/<filename>.md
Summary: <one-line summary>
<type-specific fields>"
```

**Standard notification types:**

| Agent | Type | Additional Fields |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| librarian | RESEARCH | `Confidence:`, `Sources:` |
| reviewer | REVIEW | `Blocking:`, `Non-blocking:` |
| oracle | ANALYSIS | `Status:`, `Confidence:`, `Key finding:` |
| oracle | DECISION | `Recommendation:`, `Alternatives:`, `Tradeoffs:` |
| documenter | DOCS | `Sections:` |

**Discovery patterns:**

```bash
# Find all artifacts for an issue
jwz read "issue:auth-123" | grep "Path:"

# Find all research across project
jwz search "RESEARCH:"

# Find all reviews
jwz search "REVIEW:"

# Find oracle analyses
jwz search "ANALYSIS:"
```

### Thread Continuation

Agents discovering prior work should check jwz first:

```bash
# See recent discussion for an issue
jwz read "issue:auth-123" --limit 10

# Find specific agent's contributions
jwz search "issue:auth-123" --from oracle
```

**Handoff protocol:** When completing significant work, post a summary:

```
[librarian] COMPLETE: API research
Key findings:
- Rate limiting uses token bucket algorithm
- Deprecated endpoints in v3
Artifacts: .claude/plugins/idle/librarian/rate-limiting.md
Next steps: Documenter should update API reference
```

**Note:** `explorer` is a utility agent for codebase navigation and does not post to jwz. Only agents producing artifacts or significant analyses (librarian, reviewer, oracle, documenter) participate in the notification protocol.

## Adding New Agents

1. Create `agents/your-agent.md`
2. Define frontmatter (name, description, model, tools)
3. Write clear constraints (what it MUST NOT do)
4. Define the workflow
5. Specify output format

The agent becomes available automatically as `idle:your-agent`.

## Adding New Commands

1. Create `commands/category/your-command.md`
2. Add frontmatter with description
3. Document usage and workflow
4. Define completion signals if it's a loop command

The command becomes available as `/idle:category:your-command`.
