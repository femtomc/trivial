## [0.6.1] - 2025-12-27

### Fixed

- Shell scripting robustness across all hook and command scripts:
  - `grep -qF --` for fixed-string matching with option-terminator protection
  - Complete dirty checks (staged + unstaged) in worktree status/remove/land
  - JSON injection fix in grind.md using `jq -Rs` to escape filter arguments
  - Pipeline fallback fixes in issue.md (sequential conditionals instead of broken `||`)
  - `printf` instead of `echo` in stop-hook.sh for safe handling of arbitrary data

## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added

- **Git worktrees for issues** - Each `/issue` gets its own worktree for clean isolation
- `/land <id>` command to merge completed issue branches
- `/worktree` command for worktree management (list, status, remove, prune)
- Stop hook injects worktree context on each iteration
- **Implementor agent** - Haiku-based execution agent for code changes, with Opus escalation
- **Orchestrator pattern** - `/orchestrate` command for context-saving delegation
- PreToolUse hook enforces orchestrator mode (blocks Write/Edit, redirects to implementor)
- **Stop hook for loop commands** - Self-referential iteration via Claude Code hooks
- **PreToolUse hook** - Safety guardrails blocking destructive git/bash commands
- **PreCompact hook** - Recovery anchor persisted to `loop:anchor` before compaction
- `hooks/hooks.json` and hook scripts for loop, safety, orchestration, and recovery
- Loop state stored via jwz messaging (`loop:current` topic) with JSON schema
- Stack-based nested loop model (grind → issue)
- TTL-based staleness detection (2 hour timeout prevents zombie loops)
- Environment variable escape hatch: `IDLE_LOOP_DISABLE=1`
- Hooks philosophy documented: "pull over push", "safety over policy", "pointer over payload"

### Changed

- `/issue` creates worktree with branch `idle/issue/<id>`
- Loop state includes worktree_path, branch, base_ref
- Implementor agent updated with worktree instructions (absolute paths, cd prefix)
- Loop commands (`/loop`, `/issue`, `/grind`) now use jwz for state management
- `/cancel-loop` posts ABORT event to jwz and cleans up gracefully
- Removed planner agent in favor of oracle
- Prompts stored in temp files to avoid JSON escaping issues

### Fixed

- Loop commands now actually loop (previously just documented the pattern)

## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added

- **Zawinski messaging integration** - Async topic-based messaging between agents (`jwz` CLI)
- `/message` command for posting and reading messages
- Messaging sections in all opus agents (oracle, reviewer, documenter) and librarian
